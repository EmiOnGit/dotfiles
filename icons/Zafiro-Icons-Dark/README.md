# Zafiro icons 
Minimalist icons created with the flat-desing technique, utilizing washed out colors and always accompanied by white. The priority is simplicity.

*If you find any missing application icons, please report them to me.
At the moment I only accept reports of icons of missing applications,
I am aware that icons in the other categories are still missing.*
