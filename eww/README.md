# eww: 
if you just copy my [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) setup don't forget to run: 
- `scripts/helper/launch_bar` when you want the top bar 
- `scripts/helper/toggle_dashboard` whenever you want to toggle the dashboard (automatically used by the top bar) 
I start my bar with my window manager (as most likely you want to)
for an example how to do that you might want to look in my `bspwm/bspwmrc`.
