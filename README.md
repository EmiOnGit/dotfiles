# Dotfiles

These are my personal config files I use for my linux setup.

I documented most of what I've done for the future me and possibly other people which wants take a look! :)

I generally try to take a more general approach which works with different setups so if see something I could improve on I'd appreciate you to open a Issue or make a short merge request!

Running `setup.sh` will link the config files to the right places for programs to recognize them.
(does not override if the directories already exist)
